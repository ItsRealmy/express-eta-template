# express-eta-template

A template I use for some projects. I really should've made this sooner. Anyways, it's pretty opinionated, so only use it if you 100% agree with me!

Some things I took care of:

- Install the 2 primary packages (`express` & `eta`)
- Application `type` is `"module"` (so, `import` statements instead of `require`)
- Gitignore
- .env file loading (via `dotenv`)
- Cookie parsing (via `cookie-parser`)
- Fancy console log colors (via `colors`)
- Example code
- Directory structure the way I like it!

What you should do:

- Remove all the `.gitkeep` files, you don't need 'em
- `npm i`
- Enjoy!
